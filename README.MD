# HOW TO GET STARTED
Make sure your machine as te following
- PHP 8.0
- Mysql 5.7 or up
- composer


### Setup the environment
I have included a library to easily setup the environment. You have to make a `.env` file. The variables are added in `.env.example` file
```
cp .env.example .env
```
and put appropriate values

To get started clone the repo and type
```
composer install
```

start the server by typing
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
your server will be started and you can access it by clicking here:

[Access Server](http://localhost:8000)

or directly go to
